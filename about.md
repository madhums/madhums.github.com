Hi! I am Madhusudhan, this is my blog. I'm a developer, I build awesome products for the web and mobile. I love travelling and meeting new people. You will find me in front of my mac either hacking away at code or watching science fiction or comedy.

I also [tweet](http://twitter.com/madhums), [code](http://github.com/madhums) and [reply](mailto:madhums8@gmail.com).
