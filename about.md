Hi, I am Madhu, welcome to my site! I am a Full stack programmer and a UX designer currently living in the Netherlands. I love travelling and people. I like to with work on stuff that creates an impact in the society we live in.

## What do I do?

I help startups to build online products and solutions using web and mobile technologies.

## How do I do?

- I brainstorm ideas with product owners, come up with _user stories_
- I initially _sketch_ the ideas on a _whiteboard_ to come up with the _user flows_ and think it out loud. At this phase I prefer to include the _team_ that is involved as it brings _alignment_. This is also the stage where I sometimes use parts of _[google design sprint](http://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com)_.
- Design using _[SketchApp](https://www.sketchapp.com/)_ (if needed)
- Code it!

I use [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and [Open Source Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) to implement the solutions. For web, I use [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and for mobile, [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/). And for the rest of web and mobile frontend, I use the react ecosystem. For backend, I use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

I not only use OSS to build solutions, but also believe in contributing back. Checkout my github to see OSS contributions.

If what I do intrigues you weather it's a completely new idea or an already existing product, drop me a line and I shall get back to you!
