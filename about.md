I am a software engineer, with a background in product and user experience design. I enjoy thinking about user experience as much as solving difficult technical problems.

I love programming in JavaScript and Golang. My dream is to travel around the world (also work from anywhere I want).

Most of the times, you can find me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/madhums), [github](http://github.com/madhums), [soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/madhums) and you can write to me at [ _me at madhums dot me_ ]


Thanks to [nickbalestra](https://github.com/nickbalestra/kactus) for the theme. Fork this repo [here](https://github.com/madhums/madhums.github.io).
