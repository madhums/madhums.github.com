`Hi!` I am Madhusudhan, this is my blog. I build awesome products for the web and mobile. I'm a `full-stack programmer`. From the past 2 years I have been working on `node.js` and `mongodb`. Prior to that - RubyOnRails, drupal and Coldfusion. I love opensource! I love github! I love `Javascript`!

I love travelling and meeting new people. I sleep at unusual times. You will find me in front of my mac hacking away at code, listening to progressive / house / electronica! I love science fiction, especially fringe and lost. My favourite movie is _Into the Wild_.

I also [tweet](http://twitter.com/madhums), [code](http://github.com/madhums) and [reply](mailto:me@madhums.me). Drop a hi !
